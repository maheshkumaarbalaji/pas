PASSPORT AUTOMATION SYSTEM

Developed using jQuery and PHP

Passport Automation System is used in the effective dispatch of passport to all of the applicants. This system adopts a comprehensive approach to minimize the manual work and schedule resources, time in an effective  manner. The core of the system is to get the online registration form (with details such as name, address etc.,) filled by the applicant whose testimony is verified for its correctness by the Passport Automation System with respect to the already existing information in the database. This forms the first and foremost step in the processing of passport application. After the first round of verification done by the system, the information is in turn directed to the regional administrator's  office. The application is then processed manually based on the report given by the system, and malpractice of any kind  identified can make the applicant liable to penalty as per the law. The system also provides the applicant the list of available dates for appointment to 'document verification' in the administrator's office, from which they can select one. The system forwards the necessary details to the police for its separate verification whose report is then presented to the administrator. The administrator will be provided with an option to display the current status of application to the applicant, which they can view in their online interface. After all the necessary criteria have been met, the original information is added to the database and the passport is sent to the applicant.
